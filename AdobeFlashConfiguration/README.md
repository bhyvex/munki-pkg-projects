This project builds a package that simply installs an mms.cfg file to control the configuration of Adobe Flash Player.

See (http://www.adobe.com/devnet/flashplayer/articles/flash_player_admin_guide.html) for more information.

The mms.cfg file in this project disables auto updates and analytics (sadly, this last bit is _not_ documented by Adobe.)
